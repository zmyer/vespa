/**
 * @brief This class helps you perform simple signal handling.
 *
 * A normal application will typically want to ignore SIGPIPE and
 * perform a (clean) exit on SIGINT/SIGTERM. Caught signals are
 * handled by setting a flag indicating that the signal has been
 * caught. The application itself is responsible for checking which
 * signals have been caught. Different signals are handled by
 * combining a single signal dispatch function with a pattern similar
 * to type-safe enums. All available signal handlers are created
 * during static initialization at program startup.
