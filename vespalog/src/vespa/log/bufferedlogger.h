 * \class ns_log::BufferedLogger
 * \ingroup log
 *
 * \brief Utility class for writing log less spammy.
 *
 * Uses string tokens to identify what messages are equal. Equal tokens means
 * similar message. Use tokens similar to the messages, excluding the variable
 * parts you don't want to mess up equality.
 *
 * Keeps a cache of log entries. When something is logged, check if the message
 * is already in the log cache. If so, increase the count of the log entry. If
 * it wasn't in the cache, log it to file and add it to the log cache.
 *
 * Trim the log cache if it is above maximum size or contains entries that are
 * older than the max age they can live.
 *
 * There are no separate threads polling buffer to see if log entries are older
 * than max age. Each doLog() call to the logbuffer will trigger a check.
 *
 * The log cache is a single static object, common for all loggers. This has
 * the following advantages:
 *    - Only one instance to trigger to check for old entries.
 *    - We can keep a bigger cache, preventing issues with allocating large
 *      caches to lots of loggers or having to small of a cache for heavily used
 *      loggers.
 * The disadvantage is that the cache itself needs to be able to use little
 * resources even though there's many entries in the cache.
 *
 * For the log cache to be efficient, even if it gets large, it is indexed 3
 * ways. This means that there's no operation (except flushing) that needs to
 * go through all log entries. Currently, ordered indexes accessed through
 * binary search is used to give log N complexity.
 *
 * - We need to look up entries by token to figure out if entry already exist.
 * - We need to get oldest entries to see whether they are older than max age.
 * - We need to identify entry to remove when cache is too large.
 *
 * Deciding on what entry to remove when the cache is too large is not straight
 * forward. We don't want a burst of unique log entries to clear the whole
 * buffer. We also need to make sure that the low count entries aren't starved
 * out by the higher count entries, such that no new high count entries can
 * come in.
 *
 * Suggested algorithm for deciding what entry to remove next:
 *    - Split the cache in two by timestamp. The first half of the cache
 *      contains the newest entries added. When entries are added, the last
 *      entry in the first half is moved into the last half (if first half is
 *      full). This ensures that new entries are never starved, and will always
 *      be able to build up their counts.
 *    - In the second half, when an entry needs to be removed, calculate each
 *      entry's timestamp + X * count, and remove the entry with the lowest
 *      score. This will let higher count entries live longer, but
 *      will prevent them from living forever. X is the age factor, saying
 *      how much each count counts for. For instance, if X counts for 5 seconds,
 *      this means that a log entry that you will rather remove an entry seen
 *      once 10 seconds ago, than an entry seen twice less than 15 seconds ago.
 *
 * For efficient access of the log buffer itself, boost' multi_index is used.
 * This is a container that keeps separate indexes. In the log buffer case it
 * will keep 3 indexes.
 *    - Index 0 will be the insert order. This will also be the timestamp order
 *      of the log entries, such that new entries goes in the back, and if we
 *      need to remove an entry due to old age, it will always be the first.
 *    - Index 1 will be the token. This is used for efficient lookup to find
 *      whether we have seen this entry before.
 *    - Index 2 will be the timestamp + X * count, used to find which entry to
 *      remove next if the buffer is too full. Note that this index is only
 *      needed in the second half of the buffer.
 *
 * The buffer itself is split into two parts, because this was the only way I
 * could think of to keep it log N, as the sequenced index don't have random
 * access, such that finding the middle element has N complexity, also, the
 * first half of the entries would pollute the timestamp + X * count index, such
 * that one potentially would have to check many entries before finding the
 * correct one to remove.
