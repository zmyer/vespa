# Building and running Vespa on Docker (OS X and Linux)

## Installing docker
[Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

*On Linux, the default storage device is devicemapper with loopback device and max 10GB container size. This size is too small for a full build. Please see [here](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2016/03/daemon_option_basedevicesize/) and [here](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/06/notes-on-fedora-centos-and-docker-storage-drivers/) to overcome this limitation.*


## Building Vespa RPM
Execute ```./build-vespa.sh <Vespa version number>``` to build Vespa from this source code.

The produced rpms will be available in this folder after compilation.
The version number will be compiled into binaries, but has no other meaning than that.


## Building and testing Vespa
Execute ```./vespa-ci.sh <git commit>``` to build and test a specific branch/tag/commit.


## Building Vespa Docker image
Execute ```./build-vespa-image.sh <Vespa version number>``` to build a Docker image (*vesparun*) which has the rpms
from the build step (or downloaded rpms into this folder) installed.


## Running Vespa inside Docker container
Execute ```./run-vespa.sh <Vespa version number>``` to start Vespa.

This starts a Docker container using the Docker image (*vesparun*) from the previous step.
Vespa will be started inside the container.


## Building Vespa inside a Docker container
Execute ```./enter-build-container.sh``` to enter the Vespa build environment inside a Docker container.

The container is entered at the root of the Vespa source repository. Follow the build sections in [README.md](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/README.md) to build and test.


## Troubleshooting
- Use ```docker logs CONTAINER``` for output - useful if the commands above fail.

- If the build fails, start from scratch: ```docker rmi -f vesparun vespabuild``` - then build again. Clean local docker if docker image disk full:
    - ```docker rm -v $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)```
    - ```docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)```

- _Directory renamed before its status could be extracted_ can be caused by [1219](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1219) - workaround (from the issue): "It may be an overlay storage driver issue - you can add ```{"storage-driver":"aufs"}``` in the advanced daemon preferences pane and see if that makes a difference."
