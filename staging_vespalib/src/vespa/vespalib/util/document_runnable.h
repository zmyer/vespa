 * @class document::Runnable
 * @ingroup util
 *
 * @brief Implementation of FastOS_Runnable that implements threadsafe stop.
 *
 * FastOS_Runnable can easily be used unsafe. If you use the thread pointer for
 * anything after your runnable had returned from Run(), it could affect another
 * runnable now using that thread.
 *
 * Using this class should be foolproof to avoid synchronization issues during
 * thread starting and stopping :)
