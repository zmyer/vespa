 * \class storage::framework::Component
 * \ingroup component
 *
 * \brief Application component class
 *
 * The component class is used to give a component of an application a set of
 * generic tools without depending on the implementation of these.
 *
 * This class should not depend on the actual implementation of what it serves.
 * Neither in the header file nor the object file. Implementations will be
 * provided by the application server.
 *
 * Services given should all be generic features. Application specific stuff
 * we should handle in another way. The types of services offered are split in
 * two.
 *
 *   1. Services component implementation has that it registers in the component
 *      such that application server can access this. Metrics and status
 *      reporting are two such services.
 *   2. Services provided through application server, that the application
 *      server will inject into the component before it is opened for use.
 *      Clock, thread pool and memory management are examples of such services.
 *
 * The services offered with a short summary of what they provide are as
 * follows:
 *
 *  - Status reporters can register themselves as a reported in the component.
 *    A status server, for instance serving status information through a web
 *    server can thus fetch status pages wanted by clients and serve them.
 *    Status reporters thus don't need to know how status information is used.
 *
 *  - A metric set can be registered, with a path for where in the application
 *    metric set it should exist. This way, the components do not have to know
 *    about metric management and the implementation of the metric manager.
 *
 *  - A metric update hook can be registered. This will be called by the metric
 *    implementation at regular intervals or just before snapshotting/reporting.
 *
 *  - A clock object is given. Using a common clock component all over the
 *    application makes us able to fake the clock in testing environments.
 *    Fetching current time is also a somewhat expensive operations we might
 *    do often, so having this common object to fetch it, we can easily
 *    optimize clock fetching as we see fit later.
 *
 *  - A thread pool is given. This makes us able to use a thread pool.
 *    (Allthough currently we don't really need a thread pool, as threads
 *    typically live for the whole lifetime of the server. But currently we are
 *    forced to use a thread pool due to fastos.) Another feature of this is
 *    that the thread interface has built in information needed to detect
 *    deadlocks and report status about thread behavior, such that deadlock
 *    detecting and thread status can be shown without the threads themselves
 *    depending on how this is done.
 *
 *  - A memory manager may also be provided, allowing components to request
 *    memory from a global pool, in order to let the application prioritize
 *    where to use memory. Again, this removes the dependency of how it is
 *    actually implemented to the components using it.
 *
 * Currently it is assumed that components are set up at application
 * initialization time, and that they live as long as the application. Thus no
 * unregister functionality is provided. Services that use registered status
 * reporters or metric sets will shut down before the component is deleted,
 * such that the component can be safely deleted without any unregistering
 * needed.
