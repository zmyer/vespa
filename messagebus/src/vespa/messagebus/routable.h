/**
 * Superclass for objects that can be either explicitly (Message) or implicitly
 * (Reply) routed. Note that protocol implementors should never subclass this
 * directly, but rather through the {@link Message} and {@link Reply} classes.
 *
 * A routable can be regarded as a protocol-defined value with additional
 * message bus related state. The state is what differentiates two Routables
 * that carry the same value. This includes the application context attached to
 * the routable and the {@link CallStack} used to track the path of the routable
 * within messagebus. When a routable is copied (if the protocol supports it)
 * only the value part is copied. The state must be explicitly transfered by
 * invoking the {@link #swapState(Routable)} method. That method is used to
 * transfer the state from a message to the corresponding reply, or to a
 * different message if the application decides to replace it.
