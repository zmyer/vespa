/**
 * This class contains the reserved error codes that are used by
 * messagebus. It also defines the error code ranges that may be used
 * by applications. Note that this class should never be instantiated.
 * An error code is a number with some added semantics. Legal error
 * codes are separated into 4 value ranges. An error can be either
 * fatal or transient. Inside each category, the error can be either
 * messagebus specific or application specific. A fatal error signals
 * that something is wrong and that it will not help to resend the
 * message. A transient error signals that it may help to resend the
 * message at a later time.
 * <pre>
 * transient errors:
 *     messagebus:  [100000, 150000>
 *     application: [150000, 200000>
 * fatal errors:
 *     messagebus:  [200000, 250000>
 *     application: [250000, 300000>
 * </pre>
