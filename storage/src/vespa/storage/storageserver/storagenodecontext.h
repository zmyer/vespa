 * @class storage::StorageNodeContext

 *
 * @brief Data available to both provider implementations and storage server
 *
 * This utility class sets up the default component register implementation.
 * It also sets up the clock and the threadpool, such that the most basic
 * features are available to the provider, before the service layer is set up.
 *
 * The service layer still provides the memory manager functionality though,
 * so you cannot retrieve the memory manager before the service layer has
 * started up. (Before getPartitionStates() have been called on provider)
