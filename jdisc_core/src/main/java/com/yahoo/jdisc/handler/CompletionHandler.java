/**
 * This interface defines a handler for consuming the result of an asynchronous I/O operation.
 * <p>
 * The asynchronous channels defined in this package allow a completion handler to be specified to consume the result of
 * an asynchronous operation. The {@link #completed()} method is invoked when the I/O operation completes successfully.
 * The {@link #failed(Throwable)} method is invoked if the I/O operations fails. The implementations of these methods
 * should complete in a timely manner so as to avoid keeping the invoking thread from dispatching to other completion
 * handlers.
 * <p>
 * Because a CompletionHandler might have a completely different lifespan than the originating ContentChannel objects,
 * all instances of this interface are internally backed by a reference to the {@link Container} that was active when
 * the initial Request was created. This ensures that the configured environment of the CompletionHandler is stable
 * throughout its lifetime. This also means that the either {@link #completed()} or {@link #failed(Throwable)} MUST be
 * called in order to release that reference. Failure to do so will prevent the Container from ever shutting down.
