/**
 * This interface defines a callback for asynchronously writing the content of a {@link Request} or a {@link Response}
 * to a recipient. It is the returned both by {@link RequestHandler#handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)} and {@link
 * ResponseHandler#handleResponse(Response)}. Note that methods of this channel only <em>schedule</em> the appropriate
 * action - if you need to act on the result you will need submit a {@link CompletionHandler} to the appropriate method.
 * <p>
 * Because a ContentChannel might have a different lifespan than the originating Request and Response
 * objects, all instances of this interface are internally backed by a reference to the {@link Container} that was
 * active when the initial Request was created. This ensures that the configured environment of the ContentChannel is
 * stable throughout its lifetime. This also means that the {@link #close(CompletionHandler)} method MUST be called in
 * order to release that reference. Failure to do so will prevent the Container from ever shutting down. This
 * requirement is regardless of any errors that may occur while calling any of its other methods or its derived {@link
 * CompletionHandler}s.
