/**
 * <p>This class represents a single request (which may have any content model that a {@link ServerProvider} chooses to
 * implement). The {@link #uri URI} is used by the {@link Container} to route it to the appropriate {@link
 * RequestHandler}, which in turn will provide a {@link ContentChannel} to write content to.</p>
 *
 * <p>To ensure application consistency throughout the lifetime of a Request, the Request itself holds an active
 * reference to the Container for which it was created. This has the unfortunate side-effect of requiring the creator of
 * a Request to do explicit reference counting during the setup of a content stream.</p>
 *
 * <p>For every successfully dispatched Request (i.e. a non-null ContentChannel has been retrieved), there will be
 * exactly one {@link Response} returned to the provided {@link ResponseHandler}.</p>
