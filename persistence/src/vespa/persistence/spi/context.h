/**
 * The context object is used to pass optional per operation data down to the
 * persistence layer. It contains the following:
 *
 * The load type of the operation. Users can tag their load with load types,
 * such that the backend can be configured to handle them differently. This can
 * for instance be used to:
 *   - Control what should be cached.
 *   - Keep different metrics per load type, such that users can see metrics of
 *     what they are interested in without getting them polluted with data from
 *     other types of load.
 *
 * The priority used by the service layer is given. The service layer keeps a
 * priority queue so the highest priority operations pending should be issued
 * first, but priority can also be useful in the provider, for instance for the
 * following:
 *   - Prioritize load through SPI against other load in provider.
 *   - Pause low priority load when we have high priority load running at the
 *     same time using the same resources.
 *
 * Our messagebus protocol allows tracing, which simplifies debugging. For
 * instance, if some operation is slow, one can add tracing and see where it
 * uses time, whether it has hit caches etc. As the persistence provider itself
 * can become complex, we want that also to be able to add to the trace. Thus we
 * want to give it a way to specify something that we will add to the mbus
 * trace.
